## ðŸŒ³ IOTA GoShimmer Initiative

The **IOTA GoShimmer Initiative** is a collaborative effort to help people in the IOTA Community by introducing consistent workflows around [GoShimmer](https://docs.iota.org/docs/node-software/0.1/goshimmer/introduction/overview) with content, and open source contributions.

IOTA is an open-source distributed ledger technology that allows [connected devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_Devices) to transfer data and [IOTA tokens](https://docs.iota.org/docs/getting-started/0.1/clients/token) among each other for zero fees.

## ðŸŽ¯ Initiative Goals

The GoShimmer node software is in its alpha implementation. We are currently focused on improving the node operators experience around the following four goals:

- Quality Assurance/Review
- Documentation
- Tools development
- Improvements to module/libraries

### Quality Assurance/Review

Quality Assurance/Review goal includes making sure that the tools have no obvious bugs or pitfalls that might turn node operators off from trying further once they run into them, make sure that the provided examples are clear and work for the most common use cases the release is aimed at.

> [Discuss the work-in-progress ideas for quality assurance/review here â†’]

### Documentation

Documentaion goal includes everything related to writing, curating, and sharing content with solid documentation at every launch, that is kept up-to-date, well-written explainations to support GoShimmer node operators.

> [Discuss the work-in-progress ideas for documentation here â†’]

### Tools development

Tools development goal includes automation scripts and management tools to kick start GoShimmer node operators in setting up and operate GoShimmer nodes.

> [Discuss the work-in-progress ideas for tools development here â†’]

###  Improvements to module

Improvements to module goal includes supporting the IOTA Foundation GoShimmer developers in testing modules, actively participate in network testing and managing modules on the GoShimmer nodes.

## ðŸ¤” How Can You Get Involved?

Show your interest by adding your information with an issue here on github and join the IOTA Experience Team on the [IOTA Discord](https://discord.iota.org).

## ðŸ‘¥ What to expect?

Meet every other week with IOTA Foundation members to exchange ideas, give and receive feedback for the chosen goal(s).

This initiative is possible thanks to the contribution of the IOTA Community members and participants will be invited to participate in feedback collecting and evaluating sessions to further push the capabilities of the IOTA Experience Teams.
